Phase 17: The "Liquid Glass Winamp" UI/UX Architecture
The Problem: A "Pro" Backend with a "Utility" Frontend
With the "Master Blueprint" caching (Phase 16) and the asynchronous "Intelligent Splitter" (Phase 15) complete, the backend was a robust, scalable engine. However, the frontend remained a simple "Phase 15" utility built with placeholder-style controls.

This created a major UX disconnect: a powerful, professional backend was trapped behind an "ugly" and "sloppy" frontend. The "split workspace" was a simple <ul> list, creating a "workflow dead end" (as identified in the UX Audit). This UI did not match the project's high-end "Pro" creative direction or its business_case.md value proposition.

The Solution: The "Winamp" Metaphor
The solution was a complete ground-up redesign of the index.html, replacing the entire single-page UI with a "bento box" layout directly inspired by the classic Winamp media player.

This "Winamp" metaphor provides the perfect, scalable, and modular layout for the application's entire workflow. It pays homage to the project's "Forged in the fires of Winamp" ethos and provides a clear, intuitive, and "elegant" UI for all MVP and V2.0 features.

The Creative Direction: "Liquid Glass Pro"
The aesthetic is "Liquid Glass Pro."

Background (Layer 1): The "Pro Deck" (Concept 2) VJ loop plays on a continuous, "bouncing" loop in the background, set to a dark filter (brightness(0.4)) to create the "in-the-club" vibe.

UI (Layer 2): The Winamp modules are built using a "Liquid Glass Toolkit" (Treatments 1-4). These modules "float" on top of the VJ loop. backdrop-filter: blur() and SVG filters (#glass-distortion, #mini-liquid-lens) are used to warp and refract the light from the VJ loop below, making the UI feel "alive."

The New Architecture: A 3-Module "Bento Box"
The new index.html maps the entire application workflow onto Winamp's three classic modules:

1. The "Main Player" Module (The "Job" Module)
This is the new "front door" and primary action center.

Eject Button: (Treatment 3) This is the new "Upload File" control.

Play Button: (Treatment 3) This is the standardized "Start Job" control, which runs the selected mode.

Scrub Bar: (Treatment 4) This is the "Job Progress" bar. The "liquid" thumb (.active state) appears to visualize a job in progress.

Title Display: This is the main statusText feed, which displays the job_display_name and status from the backend's /history poller.

2. The "Equalizer" Module (The "Controls" Module)
This module replaces the old slider and checkbox, housing all user inputs.

Drag & Drop: The file drop zone is now integrated into this module.

Mode Selector: (Treatment 2) A "bouncy toggle" for the three main modes: [TAG], [SPLIT], [CLEAR]. This directly controls which config is sent to the /upload_library endpoint.

Detail Selector: (Treatment 2) A second "bouncy toggle" for the three detail levels: [ | ], [ || ], [ ||| ], which correspond to Essential, Recommended, and Detailed.

V2.0 Home: This module provides a scalable home for the V2.0 "Advanced Calibration Profiles" (Techno Genius, etc.).

3. The "Playlist Editor" Module (The "Genre Hub")
This is the "elegant" solution to the "ugly list" and split-workspace-area.

Function: It is the "Genre Hub" that appears after a split_library_task is successfully completed.

Data: It consumes the result_data (the JSON list of file paths) from the /history polling response.

UI: It renders the split files (e.g., Electronic.xml (1240 tracks)) as a clickable "playlist."

The "Loopback": This module solves the "workflow dead end." It contains the "Tag this" button (/tag_split_file endpoint) for each file, allowing the user to select a split file, choose a detail level, and hit "Play" on the Main Player to run a new, targeted tagging job. It also "remembers" the split state using sessionStorage.

The Outcome
This new architecture unifies the app's powerful backend with its high-concept creative vision. It solves the core "ugly list" problem for the MVP, creates a delightful and "wild" user experience, and builds the perfect, scalable foundation for all "Future Roadmap" features.
