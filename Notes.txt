Splitting the XML:
Result:
The genre "buckets" are displayed at the bottom. The "Run Genius" button is inactive.
The main XML document cannot be accessed or tagged. The user may decide at this point that he doesnt want to tag his XMLs
    seperately.
    - The user cannot go back or reset the tag genius state.
    - The layout is awkward. View log is a pain in the ass.
    - The list is still unclear for the user about the "Tag this file" as its not explicitly clear that the user needs
        to choose a tag level before or at this fork.
    - The clear tags and Split Library should still be "or" functions to the tagger but perhaps

    -The user should always have access to the main XML.
    -Run button active before going to history. Becomes inactive on return to home.


    Run Genius Broken:

    Logs indicate that the job was successful but there is no file to download.
    The download tagged library now downloads the file and opens up the upload file window.

    Also the link shouldnt be there because its inconsistant
    - When the genius has run. The run button becomes inactive , even when I want to change the tagging level.
    - This is perhaps because TG has ejected the main XML but because the D&D area is occupied with job succession and
    download link.
    -

    - The main xml file could always stay loaded.
    - The tabs at the top could illuminate
    - Neomorphism buttons for SPlit and Clear tags?
    - The Run button could display messaging and feedback. Pulse. That solves the conditioning problem.
